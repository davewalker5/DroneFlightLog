## About

DroneFlightLog implements a SQL-based drone flight log boook. An ASP.NET WebAPI provides access to the business logic and data access layer while an ASP.NET MVC UI provides the user interface.

The logbook allows for storage and maintenance of the following data:

- Operator details
- Drones, models and manufacturers
- Flights, flight locations and flight properties

## Credits

Implementation of authentication using JWT in the REST API is based on the following tutorial:

- https://jasonwatmore.com/post/2019/10/11/aspnet-core-3-jwt-authentication-tutorial-with-example-api#users-controller-cs

The Drone Flight Log MVC project uses the Gijgo JavaScript controls library:
