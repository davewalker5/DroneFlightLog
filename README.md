## About

DroneFlightLogDb implements the entities and business logic for an SQL-based drone flight logbook, providing facilities for recording and querying the following data:

* Flights, flight locations and flight properties

It is implemented in C# and uses Entity Framework Core.

It supports the following database types:

| Type | Purpose |

| In Memory | In-memory database for transient storage and targetted at unit testing |
| SQLite | Permanent storage in a SQLite database |
